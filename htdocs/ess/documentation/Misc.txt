Expense Submittal System (ESS) Release 7
========================================
Updated: October 15th (for Rel 7.0.4)

Note: User and technical documentation is available 
on ExpenseServices.com's web site (http://expenseservices.com).  
Support is also available on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/expense-ss) 
and on Yahoo Users' Groups 
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenSourceExpense/).

Please review this file as it contains important information 
to get you up and running with ESS.



Try it out first!
=================
This system has been installed at http://expenseservices.com as a service.  You can
subscribe to and use the basic service for free.  This way you can take ESS for a test
drive before installing this package.  Please note that the basic service does not 
have all the features of the package that you are downloading.  If you have any 
questions contact service@expenseservices.com.  



Database Support Changes
========================

ESS on SourceForge is QA'd against the MySQL database.  The configuration files for Oracle 
are provided in case you want to use an Oracle server.  The MS SQLServer configurations are not 
currently up-to-date, but are available by contacting service@expenseservices.com.
If you wish to update them (by comparing them to the MySQL files) you can use them.  


Installers
==========

As of October 15, 2011 there are no installers for version 7.0.  All installations
must be performed manually.

As soon as the installers have been updated and tested they will be made available
on SourceForge.  We plan on providing installers for existing Web and app server 
installations on Windows and Linux.  We do not have plans to ship LAMP stacks in the
near future as we did in the past 


User Menus
==========

One of the most powerful options ESS provides is the ability, by 
editing HTML files, to custom tailor menus for your users.  To 
get you started ESS is shipped with the following menus:

1 - Very simple menu and supports foreign travel.
2 - Supports client billing, project tracking, foreign travel,  and password change.
    foreign travel, and password change.
3 - Very simple menu and supports foreign travel. Includes support for scan receipt files.
4 - Supports client billing, project tracking, foreign travel,  and password change.
    foreign travel, and password change. Includes support for scan receipt files.
8 - Fully loaded with screens that allow for the capture of GST.  
    Great for Australia, Canada, etc.  You can remove any options 
    you don't want.

To change a user's menu, log into the Audit module and access 
the User File: User Primary screens.


JDBC Database Drivers, etc.
===========================

ESS uses JDBC to connect to your database.  The drivers mentioned 
here are all jar files that contain Java class files.

If you use MySQL, you're set. The MySQL JDBC drivers ship with ESS 
and will automatically be installed in the webapps/WEB-INF/lib folder.

If you are using Microsoft SQL Server, you need to download the drivers 
from Microsofts Web site.  There is an installation program that gets run.  
After you download the drivers you need to move them to the
webapps/WEB-INF/lib folder.  The files you need to copy are msbase.jar, 
mssqlserver.jar and msutil.jar.

If you are using Oracle, you need to copy the JDBC drivers into the 
webapps/WEB-INF/lib folder.  Drivers for Java 1.4 are nls_charset12.jar 
and ojdbc14.jar.  The drivers for Java 1.3 are classes12.jar and 
mls_charset12.jar. You may be able to find these drivers in your 
oracle/ora92/jdbc/lib folder.

Another note regarding the Oracle dirvers: The Installer will give 
you, as a default, the following string:

jdbc:oracle:thin@localhost:1521:adisoft

An explanation for each item is:

     jdbc:oracle:thin - driver being used.
     localhost - address of the machine hosting the Oracle server.  
                 This can be a URL or IP.
     1521 - port that the Oracle server listens to.  1521 is the 
            standard port.
     adisoft - SID of the database being used.

With an Oracle install, you'll probably endup changing some of these.

Database Connection Strings
===========================

The ESS Installer uses the following database connection strings:

MySQL: jdbc:mysql//localhost/adisoft?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull
MS SQl Server: jdbc:microsoft:sqlserver://localhost:1433;SelectMethod=cursor
Oracle: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:adisoft

Installers will let you change these strings if you need to.  The defaults 
will work if the database server is on the same machine as the app server.  
If you are not using one of the Installers, or you want to change the 
string after installation, you'll need to change the string in the system.xml 
file (ess/xmls), in the web.xml file (webapps/ess-app/WEB-INF) and on the 
2 URLs used to generate the JavaScript profiles described below. 


Security Settings
=================

ESS reads and writes information to your hard disk in the form of xml 
files, log files and JavaScript files.  In addition to being able to execute 
html and JSP, it is important that the user that launches the Tomcat service 
has the ablitily to create and write the following:

/var/ess, c:\ess folder or equivalent - These folders will hold logs and user 
data that the system creates and adds to as it is run.

Folder from where Tomcat is started - In the event that the expense.log 
cannot be opened in one of the folders, it will attempt to open the log in the 
folder that it is pointed to when Tomcat is started.

Linux Security Note: Make sure that the user installing ESS has adequate 
privileges to modify the web and app server directories.  Because user 
launching Tomcat has needs to have adequate privileges to write to the 
/var/ess folder and that user may be different from the user installing 
ESS, the Linux installation routine applys 777 as the privilege - protection 
level.  System Admins should review this folder, together with the user that 
launches Tomcat and make appropriate ownership and privilege changes.

Maintenance
===========

From Time to time, you'll want to perform some basic maintenance on the 
Expense Submittal System.

1. ESS logs all important actions to the 'expense.log' log.  If you 
   stick with the default settings, 'expense.log will either be in 
   '/var/ess' or 'c:\ess'. You'll need to search your disk drive to 
   find the exact location of the log.  As 'expense.log' serves as an 
   audit trail, it is never automatically deleted.  Therefore, you'll 
   want to backup up the log and delete it from time to time depending 
   on your report volume.
