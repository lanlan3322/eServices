    <td width="84%"><font face="Courier New" size="2"><b>Travel And Entertainment Expenses</b>
    are generally acceptable as business expenses provided adequate records are maintained to
    substantiate:<dir>
      <p>&#149; The amount of the expenditures.</p>
      <p>&#149; The time and place of the travel and/or entertainment.</p>
      <p>&#149; The business reason and/or the business benefit derived, or expected to be
      derived from the expenditure.</p>
      <p>&#149; The business relationship of the persons being entertained.</p>
    </dir>
    <p>Failure to adequately substantiate travel and entertainment expenditures may result in
    their disallowance.</p>
    <b><p>Company Pays All Necessary Expenses</b> incurred away from your base area of
    operation while on company business or in connection with securing sales: i.e., travel,
    lodging, meals, telephone calls, etc. </p>
    <p><b>Base Area Of Operation</b> is defined as that area from which it is practical (not
    additional burden) to travel home for the night. It is based on locating your living
    quarters at the most advantageous point of the entire area which you must cover.</p>
    <b><p>Nature &amp; Amount Of Expense May Vary</b> by geographic location and the objective
    sought. Therefore, use common sense in the disbursement of company funds. </p>
    <p><b>Spouse Travel</b> is not allowed.</p>
    <b><p>Cash Advances</b>. All advance expense funds are considered to be a liability of the
    associate drawing them until expense reports are submitted and approved. Normally no more
    than one advance should be outstanding at any given time.</p>
    <b><p>Corporate Aircraft Expenses</b>. Technical Services Accounting charges out the cost
    of the trip to the department of the associate incurring the expense. This is not to be
    included in the expense report.</p>
    <b><p>Two Or More Associates On The Same Trip</b>. Where two or more associates incur
    expenses on a trip taken together, separate accounting of expenses is to be reported. </p>
    <b><p>Meals For Other Kohler Co. Associates</b> will be disallowed if they are within
    their base area of operation or if there is no apparent business purpose for the expense.</p>
    <b><p>Another Department May Be Charged</b> if the expense report is approved by the
    recipient department&#146;s manager.</p>
    <b><p>Maintain A Record Of Expenses Daily</b>. All expenses to be reimbursed by Kohler Co.
    should be maintained on a daily basis. A small notebook can be used for this purpose. Do
    not depend on your memory.</font></td>

    <td width="84%"><font face="Courier New" size="2"><b>Use Expense Report System</b>.
    Following an authorized business trip, you are required to complete an expense report to
    account for all expenses and to receive proper reimbursement for expenses over and above
    any cash advance given. Receipts must be mailed to your respective Accounting area for
    reimbursement. Use K-4424 Expense Receipt Record.<b><p>Expense Reports Due Following
    Friday</b>. It is expected that all expense reports will be submitted by the end of the
    week following the week or weeks for which the advance applied. As agreed to on K-1280,
    Requisition For Funds, an approved expense report will be submitted no later than 30 days
    after the conclusion of the trip for cash advances.</p>
    <b><p>Cash Due Kohler Co.</b> If you do not travel on company business the following week,
    return the Balance Due Kohler Co. to the Cashier for a two-part receipt. Include one of
    these receipts in the Expense Receipt Record K-4424 before submitting for processing.</p>
    <b><p>Do Not Send Cash Through The Mail</b>. Accounting Practices will not assume
    responsibility for lost cash. Send only personal checks or travelers checks made payable
    to Kohler Co. to protect yourself against loss or theft.</p>
    <b><p>Cash Due Associate</b>. When total expenses are greater than any advances provided,
    you will be reimbursed for the difference.</p>
    <b><p>Approvals</b>. All items are subject to at least your immediate supervisor's
    approval. Immediate supervisors are not to approve expense reports which request
    reimbursement of expenses incurred on their behalf. These expenses must be approved by the
    next highest level of supervision. Some divisions or groups may require additional
    approvals.</p>
    <p><b>Unacceptable Expenses</b> will be brought to your attention and the approver's
    attention and will be disallowed. Any disallowed items will be billed to you or deducted
    from the amount due you.</p>
    <b><p>Reporting Omission</b>: e.g., failure to report airline tickets, will be brought to
    your attention and to the approver's attention. If the omissions are identified during the
    processing of the report, the report will be returned to you for correction. If the
    omissions are identified subsequent to the processing of the original report, a
    supplementary report will have to be filed to account for the omitted items.</font></td>

      includes, but is not limited to, personal or departmental refreshments, snacks or coffee

      always total the original amount of the fund. Be aware that the fund you are responsible
      for is subject to surprise audits by both the Internal Audit staff and the audit staff of
      Arthur Andersen. </p>
