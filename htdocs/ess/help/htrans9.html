<p class="BodyHeader">Split Receipt</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">This screen is used to apply a single expenditure across multiple
expense types and/or departments (cost centers).&nbsp; In order to split the expense
across departments, you need to know the department numbers. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The Split Receipt screen is broken into two sections.&nbsp; The top
section is used to enter information that is common to the receipt.&nbsp; The bottom
section describes the expense type and department breakdown.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">These are the fields and links that are used to enter information
in the top part of the screen:</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Receipt Date: - (required) Enter the date from the receipt.&nbsp;
For expense without a physical receipt, enter the date the expense was incurred.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Receipt Amount: - (required) Enter the total receipt amount here.
&nbsp; When a foreign currency is used, this field is protected and entry occurs via the
Foreign Amount field. The Split Receipt screen will insure that the receipt amount equals
the total for the expense amounts.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Reference: - Enter the receipt or document reference number. &nbsp;
Since you will be charging other departments, it is important that you establish a clear
audit trail.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Purpose: (list) - (required) Select the purpose form your report to
which you want to tie this expense.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody"># of Persons: - Enter the number of persons covered by this receipt
for guideline checking purposes.&nbsp; This should be a whole number, 1 or greater.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Amount remaining to distribute: - (protected) </p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The bottom part of the screen is made up of rows and columns.
&nbsp; Each expense entry (i.e., line item) is represented by a row.&nbsp; Up to ten rows
may be entered.&nbsp; The columns are as follows:</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Expense Type (list) - (required) Select the most appropriate
expense type for this expense. One receipt can have several different expense types.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Amount - (required) Enter the receipt/expense amount here. &nbsp;
When a foreign currency is used, this field is protected and entry occurs via the Foreign
Amount field.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Depart - (list) This column provides the department name.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Bill - (list) This is 'Yes' or 'No'.&nbsp; 'Yes' to bill expenses
to the client specified in the associated purpose.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Comment - Enter any explanation for the expense here.&nbsp; If no
explanation beyond the trip purpose is called for, leave this field blank.&nbsp; Although
optional, some expense types require an explanation in the comment field be present.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The screen also contains the following links and buttons to assist
in entering information:</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody"><img src="../calendar.gif" alt="calendar.gif (171 bytes)" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16"> calendar
- This link will pop-up a calendar.&nbsp; Any date that you select by clicking on it will
be entered into the associated date field.&nbsp; The single arrows will move the calendar
one month while the double arrows move the calendar a year.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Update report with this receipt (button) - (required) After you
have entered all the information required to describe thisreceipt-expense, click this
button to add this information to the report you are creating or editing.&nbsp; If you
exit the this screen without using this button, the information you provided will not be
added to the report and will be lost.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Return to report display (link) - Use this link if you wish to
abandon data entry and return to the report display without saving any of the information
you may have added or changed. </p>
