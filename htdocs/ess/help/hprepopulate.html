<p class="BodyHeader">Pre-populated (Credit Card) Charges</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">This screen provides you with a list of charges with which to
populate an expense report.&nbsp; You will not have to reenter these items if you select
the charges from the list at the bottom of the screen. These charges have been received by
your accounting department directly from the various vendors.&nbsp; They are the result of
purchases with corporate credit cards, direct billings, etc.&nbsp; Travel advances are
also included in the list.&nbsp; This module is designed to save you entry time.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">To populate your report with an item(s) from this screen, do the
following: 

<ol>
  <li><p class="ExpenseBody">In the top section select or create a purpose that you want to
    associate the select charges with.&nbsp; By using the select list labeled 'Existing
    Purpose' you can select an purpose that has already been specified or you can create a new
    purpose by selecting 'New Purpose' you can create by entering the information in the form.
    &nbsp; For information on the fields and select lists found in the purpose section of this
    screen, consult the&nbsp; <a href="hhead2a.html">Single Purpose</a> help.&nbsp; Note: In
    the current version of this system, it is not possible to tie a pre-populate charge to a
    Multi Purpose.&nbsp; To tie charges to a Multi Purpose, you'll need tie them to a Single
    Purpose and then edit them.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="ExpenseBody">Check the charges that you wish to tie to the specified purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p class="ExpenseBody">Click the 'Add purpose and selected items to report' button.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The items will be added to your report.&nbsp; You can now treat
them as any other item, with the exception that since the items are tied to specific
charges you cannot change their payment method.&nbsp; If for some reason, you need to
start over with a charge, you can recovered any charge until it has been reconciled by
accounting with the 'Recover Charges' menu option in the maintenance section.</p>
