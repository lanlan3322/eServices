<p class="BodyHeader"><big>Expense Submittal System</big></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">To create a report, use the menu on the left.&nbsp; All the option
that you need are fould under the &quot;Create Report&quot; section.&nbsp; Start with the
&quot;Start New Report&quot; and use each sub-menu option sequentially to add your travel
receipts/expenses, mileage claim, account for advance/returned funds.&nbsp; When you have
entered your information you should save your work with the Save Report to Server option.
&nbsp; You can enter a report in as many sessions as you want to.&nbsp; When you have
completed your report you need to submit is for approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="BodyHeader"><u><strong>The Top Banner Functions</strong></u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The links on the banner are used to display the report that you are
working on so you can edit it, show this manual, contact support personnel, and logout of
ESS.&nbsp; It is always a good idea to logout of ESS rather than just closing you browser.
&nbsp; When you use the logout checks are preformed that will help prevent data loss.</p>

<p class="BodyHeader"><u><strong>Left-side Menu Options</strong></u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The menu on the left-side of your browser contains the following
options:</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Create Report</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Start New Report - This link will display a screen that allows you
to enter the trip purpose.&nbsp; Each report needs to have at least one purpose.&nbsp; A
purpose often describes a trip and the reason you took it.&nbsp; Sometimes a purpose is
not associated with a trip, but is otherwise business related so describe why you needed
to incurred the expense.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Add Receipts - Use this screen to enter any expense that is not a
hotel bill or mileage claim.&nbsp; ESS is a receipt based screen so enter your expenses
from the reciepts that you have collected.&nbsp; There may be some expenses where receipts
are not required, you can enter them here also. This screen allows entry of up to five
receipts/ expenses on one screen.&nbsp; If you need more, you can call this screen
multiple times. A group of five entries can only be tied to one purpose or currency.
&nbsp; If you have more than one purpose or currency, you will need to enter your
receipts/expenses on multiple screens.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Add Mileage - Use this screen to make a mileage claim.&nbsp; You
can use this screen multiple times.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Add Hotel Receipt - This screen lets you enter a Hotel receipt.
&nbsp; It will expense the primary amount to lodging expense while letting you breakout
items such as laundry and meals to their appropriate expense categories. You can use this
screen multiple times.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Enter an Advance - If you have taken a cash advance, you can use
this screen to account for it.&nbsp; The amount of the advance is normally netted against
your reimbursement amount.&nbsp; To see which, if any, advances are assigned to you, you
can use the Pre-Populated Charges Wizard above. </p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Returned Funds - This allows you to account for any payments that
you are including with this report.&nbsp; Normally you'll only use this option if you have
taken an advance and are returning a portion of it with the report.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Add Another Purpose - It is possible to have more than two purposes
on one report. In other words, you can combine two trips on one report.&nbsp; If you have
more than one purpose, make sure you tie your receipts/expenses to the correct trip or
purpose.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Save Report to Server - This option saves the report that you are
currently working on to the Web server.&nbsp; This will give you access to the report, via
the ListYour Reports option, at a later time.&nbsp; Make sure that you always save your
report or you will lose it.</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Get Reimbursed</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Submit for Approval. - This option submits the report for approval
and reimbursement.&nbsp; Reports are routed prior to payment for approval.&nbsp; If you
use this option twice (or more) the latest report will override a previous report, unless
the previous report has been paid already.&nbsp; As part of the submission process, a
guideline compliance check is performed.&nbsp; You must submit every report for approval
to get paid.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Information</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Printable Display - This displays a screen of the currently open
report that is suitable for printing.&nbsp; There is a link, as part of the display, that
will invoke Windows print routine.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">List Your Reports - Use this option to list the report that you
have saved and submitted.&nbsp; You can select a report for viewing and editing.&nbsp;
This option also gives the current status of the report if it has already been submitted.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Report History - If you want to view or checkup on a report that
you have already submitted, use this option.&nbsp; You can also look at reports that you
have signed on or that have been submitted by a subordinate.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Simple Inquiries - This is a list of canned reports that allow you
to look at your expenses and expenses of subordinates over a time period.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Consult with you A/P manager for further information.</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Maintenance</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Approve Reports - If you are responsible for approving expense
reports, use this option to select and signoff on the reports you are responsible for.
&nbsp; If you are an approver, you should get in the habit of checking this option
routinely.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Close Current Report - This option will close the current report
you are working on and provide a 'blank' report so you can fill it out.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Copy Report - This option will make a new copy of a report that you
have open.&nbsp; This allows you to &quot;reuse&quot; old reports as templates for new
ones.&nbsp; Important to remember, the report that is being copied is the one that is
open.&nbsp; Use the Your Reports option to select a report for copying.&nbsp; After you
have used this option, the report that is open will be the copy.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Manage Personal Data - This option allows you to edit and delete
information in your personal database.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Recover Charges - This is used to restore items, that have already
been selected for reporting, back to the prepopulated charges list that displays in the
Prepopulated Charges wizard.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Logout - Exits the system and returns to a specified home page.</p>
