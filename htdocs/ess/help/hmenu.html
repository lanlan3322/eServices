<p class="BodyHeader">Menu Options</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The menu on the left-side of your browser contains the following
options:</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Expense Wizards</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Day Trip Wizard - This is a comprehensive simple expense report.
&nbsp; For many reports, those that cover a single purpose and are comprised of a couple
expenses, can be completed by accessing this screen alone.&nbsp; You can also use this
screen to start a report and then add on to it with the items in the Expense Entry, Fleet
Vehicle and Exception Advances sections.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Multiple Receipt Wizard - Use this option to enter several basic
receipts at once.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Pre-populated Charges - This wizard allows you access to prepaid
items such as airline tickets and advances.&nbsp; By specifying the purpose and selecting
the item, you can create a report without having to rekey the details.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Close Current Report - This option will close the current report
you are working on and provide a 'blank' report so you can fill it out.</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Expense Entry</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Start New Report - This link is basically the single purpose option
with a process to assist you in creating a new report.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Single Purpose - Use this screen to enter a single purpose or
reason for expenses.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Multi Purpose - Like the Single Purpose Trip screen, but this
screen allows you to assign expense, based on percentage, to up to 4 different,
client-project-account combinations.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Basic (Quick) Receipt - This screen allows entry of a single
receipt-expense line item.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Mileage - Use this screen to make a mileage claim.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Hotel Receipt - This screen lets you enter a Hotel receipt. &nbsp;
It will expense the primary amount to lodging expense while letting you breakout items
such as laundry and meals to their appropriate expense categories.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Split Receipt - This screen lets you breakdown a single receipt to
up to ten different expense-department line items.&nbsp; This is particularly useful when
you want to share expenses between departments (i.e., cost centers).</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Fleet Vehicles</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Odometer Reading - This screen lets you make your required odometer
and vehicle usage report.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Fleet Allowance - Use this screen to claim you vehicle allowance.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Mileage - Use this screen to make a mileage claim.</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Exception Advances</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Advances - If you have taken a cash advance, you can use this
screen to account for it.&nbsp; The amount of the advance is normally netted against your
reimbursement amount.&nbsp; To see which, if any, advances are assigned to you, you can
use the Pre-Populated Charges Wizard above. </p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Returned Funds - This allows you to account for any payments that
you are including with this report.&nbsp; Normally you'll only use this option if you have
taken an advance and are returning a portion of it with the report.</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Process</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Save Report to Server - This option saves the report that you are
currently working on to the Web server.&nbsp; This will give you access to the report, via
the Your Reports option, at a later time.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Submit for Reimburse. - This option submits the report for
reimbursement.&nbsp; Reports are normally routed prior to payment.&nbsp; If you use this
option twice (or more) the latest report will override a previous report, unless the
previous report has been paid already.&nbsp; As part of the submission process, a
guideline compliance check is performed.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Approve Reports - If you are responsible for approving expense
reports, use this option to select and signoff on the reports you are responsible for.
&nbsp; If you are an approver, you should get in the habit of checking this option
routinely.</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Display/Print</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Show Current Report - This shows the current report that you have
open.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Print Report - This displays a screen of the currently open report
that is suitable for printing.&nbsp; There is a link, as part of the display, that will
invoke Windows print routine.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Guideline Check - This option checks guideline compliance.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Your Reports - Use this option to list the report that you have
saved and submitted.&nbsp; You can select a report for viewing and editing.&nbsp; This
option also gives the current status of the report if it has already been submitted.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Report History List - If you want to view or checkup on a report
that you have already submitted, use this option.</p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Maintenance</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Copy Report - This option will make a new copy of a report that you
have open.&nbsp; This allows you to &quot;reuse&quot; old reports as templates for new
ones.&nbsp; Important to remember, the report that is being copied is the one that is
open.&nbsp; Use the Your Reports option to select a report for copying.&nbsp; After you
have used this option, the report that is open will be the copy.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Manage Personal Data - This option allows you to edit and delete
information in your personal database.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Recover Charges - This is used to restore items, that have already
been selected for reporting, back to the prepopulated charges list that displays in the
Prepopulated Charges wizard.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Logout - Exits the system and returns to a specified home page.</p>
