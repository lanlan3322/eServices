<p class="ExpenseBody">This screen is used to edit a receipt that has been created via the
Pre-populated Wizard.&nbsp; The only difference between it and the Basic Receipt screen is
that it is not possible to access the Payment method field via this screen as that
information is determined by the Credit Card feed.&nbsp; For field related information,
see the <a href="htrans1afx.html">Basic Reciept</a> help.</p>
