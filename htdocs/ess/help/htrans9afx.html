<p class="BodyHeader">Split Receipt</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">This screen is used to apply a single expenditure across multiple
expense types and/or departments (cost centers).&nbsp; In order to split the expense
across departments, you need to know the department numbers. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The Split Receipt screen is broken into two sections.&nbsp; The top
section is used to enter information that is common to the receipt.&nbsp; The bottom
section describes the expense type and department breakdown.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">These are the fields and links that are used to enter information
in the top part of the screen:</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Receipt Date: - (required) Enter the date from the receipt.&nbsp;
For expense without a physical receipt, enter the date the expense was incurred.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Currency: - This field contains the name of the currency the
expense was originally incurred in if it was a non-U.S. Dollar transaction.&nbsp; For U.S.
Dollars this field will always be blank. This field is always updated with the Select
Currency link.&nbsp; When a currency is present, enter the reciept amount into the Foreign
Amount field.&nbsp; The U.S. Amount field will be updated automatically based on the
conversion rate of the currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this field is blank, indicating
the receipt is in U.S. Dollars, receipt amounts should be entered into the U.S. Amount
field and the Foreign Amount field will be blank.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Amount: - (required) Enter the total receipt amount here. &nbsp;
When a foreign currency is used, this field is protected and entry occurs via the Foreign
Amount field. The Split Receipt screen will insure that the receipt amount equals the
total for the expense amounts.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Foreign Amount: -&nbsp; If the receipt is in a foreign currency,
enter the foreign amount here.&nbsp; This field is blank and protected for U.S. Dollar
receipts.</p>

screens.&nbsp; Although filling out attendees is usual optional, some expense type, such

<p class="ExpenseBody">Reference: - Enter the receipt or document reference number. &nbsp;
Since you will be charging other departments, it is important that you establish a clear
audit trail.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Purpose: (list) - (required) Select the purpose form your report to
which you want to tie this expense.</p>

may be entered.&nbsp; The columns are as follows:</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Expense Type (list) - (required) Select the most appropriate
expense type for this expense. One receipt can have several different expense types.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Amount - (required) Enter the receipt/expense amount here. &nbsp;
When a foreign currency is used, this field is protected and entry occurs via the Foreign
Amount field.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Foreign Amount -&nbsp; If the receipt is in a foreign currency,
enter the foreign amount here.&nbsp; This field is blank and protected for U.S. Dollar
reciepts.</p>
