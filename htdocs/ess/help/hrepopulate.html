<p class="ExpenseBody">To recover a pre-populated item(s) in the Local Expense Submittal
System (LESS), you need to log-on to the Web-based ESS system and run the menu option
&quot;Recover Charges&quot; located in the &quot;Maintenance&quot; section at the bottom
of the menu.&nbsp; Select the charge or advance that you wish to recover by clicking the
appropriate box in the &quot;Recover&quot; column.&nbsp; After you have selected all
items, select the &quot;Recover checked receipts to reuse&quot; button.&nbsp; The
Web-based ESS system will recover the items and take you to the &quot;Pre-populated
Charges&quot; screen.&nbsp; You may exit the Web-based ESS system at this point and return
to LESS.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">It is necessary to redownload the recovered items with the
&quot;Profile/Pre-pop Update&quot; option.</p>
