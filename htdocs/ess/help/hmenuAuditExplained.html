<p class="BodyHeader">Audit Menu Explained!</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The menu that you are currently using only contains a small subset of 
the options found in the full Audit and Administration menu.  We've done this so that you
can see the most important options and at the same time ensure that all your information remains
confidential.  With the current menu, you can audit reports, do research on your expenses, and maintain your test
user base.  This should give you a good feel for how the expense report process is handled.</p>


<p class="ExpenseBody">To view the other Admin and Audit menu option, you can either download and
install the software from SourceForge.net or contact us.  The links to do either of these items
are located on our <a href="http://www.expenseservices.com">home page</a></p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Full Menu Contents:</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">The options under 'Audit' provide you with working audit queues.
&nbsp; A working queue is a list of reports from which you can select a report to edit or
approve for further processing.&nbsp; As an auditor, once you approve a report for further
processing, it can be be paid.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Edit and Audit - All the reports that you can audit as shown in a
working queue.&nbsp; Normally these are reports that have been approved and are ready for
further processing.&nbsp; Batch auditing is possible from this screen.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Fast Track - This is a working queue for all the reports that you
can audit that do not require any additional paper documentation to process.&nbsp; The
idea is that these reports can be processed quickly via the screen.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Report Selection - You can create a working queue based on your own
parameters.&nbsp; You can select reports based on status, reporter, reference # and date
range.&nbsp; Some reports may appear that you cannot edit or audit, however, you can
review them. </p>

<p class="BodySubHeader"><u>Process:</u></p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Release for Payment - This option creates the daily payment batch.
&nbsp; Once a report has audited, it can be released for payment with this option.&nbsp; A
report that is added to the daily batch simply has its status updated.&nbsp; There is no
other processing done at this point.&nbsp; Reports that have been audited can be excluded
from the batch creation process by unchecking them.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">EOD Feed Creation - Reports that are part of a batch are used to
create export files for processing by other systems.&nbsp; EOD feeds can be run for any
batch date.</p>

been processed and payment has been made.&nbsp; This option is usually run right after the

having the e-mail message sent out by unchecking them.</p>

<p class="ExpenseBody">Follow-up Notifications - Generates e-mail messages that remind a
reporter or approver that they have expense reports that need some sort of attention.
&nbsp; Messages are generated to remind approvers to approve (or reject) outstanding

mamanger are a spcified period of time.&nbsp; Reporters are also remind if they have
reports, as indicated by a manager reject status, that require attention. </p>

'VERIFYING' to 'ACH'.&nbsp; This is usually done 10 days after a user has been prenoted
and no rejection has been returned.&nbsp; Consult your bank for specific information
regarding your process.&nbsp; Once a reporter's Reimbursement Method has been changed to
'ACH', they will be included the batch ACH feed.</p>
